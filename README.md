# varia
Download manager based on aria2

I will write this once this app is released on Flathub.

This application relies on the following pieces of software:
- aria2: GPL v2 License (aria2 itself relies on OpenSSL: OpenSSL License)
- aria2p: ISC License

The licenses of all of these pieces of software can be found in the dependencies_information directory in this application's app directory.
